# Unifying Data Model

The Ed-Fi Data Standards are built upon a Unifying Data Model, an enterprise
data model of commonly exchanged and shared K–12 education data. The model
includes entities such as students, teachers, assessment results, attendance,
and many others that will be easily recognized by professionals in the education
field.

The core purpose of the model is to capture and represent data related to
student performance. Over time, the model has been expanded to adjacent domains
critical to K–12 education, but indirectly related to student performance (e.g.,
staff assignments and credentials; finance data; etc.).

The Unifying Data Model contains some domains with minimal coverage, generally
because other industry standards exist to cover data exchange in those areas. In
these cases, the model typically captures enough information to assist with
interpretation of data entities covered in the model, but not enough to drive
system interoperability. Curricular content is an example of a domain minimally
covered in the Ed-Fi Unifying Data Model.

Currently supported:

| Version                  | End of Support  |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |
| [Version 5.1](./v5.1.md) | June 30, 2028 * |
| [Version 4.0](./v4.0.md) | June 30, 2026   |
| [Version 3.3](./v3.3.md) | June 30, 2025   |

\* The Version 5 support through 2028 is always for the most recent minor point
release. Thus once version 5.2 is released, version 5.1 will no longer be
supported on its own, because 5.2 will be fully backward compatible with 5.1.

Other legacy versions are provided for convenience, but are officially no longer
supported by the Ed-Fi Alliance.
