<h2>Background</h2>

                <h3>District Dashboard Metrics</h3><p>As the ultimate goal of high school campuses is to graduate students ready for college within four years, many states are including a graduation rate metric into their dashboards. In addition, during focus groups conducted with educators, the High School Completion Rate metric was considered useful by 97% of those surveyed.<br />&nbsp;</p><h3>Primary Metric</h3><ul><li><strong>High School Completion Rate:</strong>&nbsp;percentage of students, from a ninth grade cohort, who have completed high school within four years</li></ul><h3>Related Metric</h3><ul><li><strong>High School Graduation Rate</strong>: percentage of students graduating within four years of entering the ninth grade.</li></ul>
              
<h2>User Interface</h2>

                <h3>Dashboard Example</h3><p>Figure 1 shows the High School Completion Rate metric as seen on the district dashboard.</p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="../../externallygeneratedcontent/spinerimages/1378/dist_hscompletionrate.png" /></p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Figure 1 High School Completion Rate</strong></p><h3>Status Definition</h3><p style="text-align:left">The High School Completion Rate metric displays the status of a group (cohort) of students after four years of high school.</p><p style="text-align:left">The Status indicator is determined by district goals.

<h2>Data Anomalies</h2>

                <h3>Data Anomalies</h3><p>Best practice is to footnote each anomaly.</p><h3>Date of Refresh</h3><p>Best practice is for the date of last data refresh to appear next the metric in the following format:</p><ul><li>(Through Spring Semester 2010)</li></ul>
              
<h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>

                <h3>Student Identity</h3><p>Maintaining a correct and consistent student identity is at the center of any education data system. Most systems use some sort of unique identifier. However, sometimes this identifier is entered incorrectly or sometimes different systems use different identifiers.</p><p>The UDM XML supports the interchange of multiple types of identifiers. The StudentReference is a complex type within the UDM to maintain the <em>referential integrity</em> of the student (that is, ensuring that the data associated with each student is accurately associated with the right student).&nbsp;The complex type of the student reference assists with implementing the accurate matching algorithm to identify a student by utilizing any of the individual attributes (e.g., Student Unique State ID, Student ID, Campus Local ID (with Campus ID), Name and Birth Date).&nbsp;For example, if the Student Unique State ID is unknown, you can find the student&rsquo;s identity by their Student ID, First Name, Last Name and Birth Date.&nbsp;</p><h3>Threshold</h3><p>The Completion Rate threshold for the states can vary.</p><h3>Cohort</h3><ul><li><p>A student who transfers into the cohort is one who, for example, moves into the cohort from another in-state high school or from out of state.</p></li><li><p>A student who transfers out of the cohort is one who, for example, moves to another in-state public high school; these students are then transferred into the cohort of the receiving high school and district. There are also students who move out of the state or out of the country, or students who transfer to private schools or who are home-schooled. These types of transfers cannot be tracked, and students who leave for these reasons are not included in completion rate calculations.</p></li><li><p>Students do not change cohorts even if they repeat a grade or skip a grade. If they begin with the 2004-05 ninth grade cohort, they remain with that cohort. This means, for example, that a student who started the ninth grade in 2004-05, but takes 6 years to graduate (i.e., in May 2010) is still part of the 2004-05 cohort; they are not switched to the 2006-07 cohort. This student is considered a continuing student, and counted as part of the Continued High School number for the class or 2008.</p></li><li><p>Dropouts are counted according to the dropout definition in place the year they drop out. The definition changed in 2005-06. Completion rates for classes in which the new dropout definition is being phased in (i.e., classes of 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009) are not comparable to completion rates for prior classes, nor to each other.</p></li><li><p>Special Education students who graduate with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) are included as graduates.</p></li><li><p>This indicator is computed and reported for districts as well as for high schools that served grade 9 and either grade 11 or grade 12 in both the first year of the cohort and in the fall following the cohort&#39;s expected graduation. Campuses that only serve some of these grades or that have been in existence for fewer than five years do not show a completion rate.</p></li><li>Dropouts do not account for those who later receive a GED.</li></ul><ul><li>Does not account for any other exclusions such as TJPC or TYC facilities, migrant students who enroll by mid January, and students not eligible for FSP funding.</li></ul><h3>Completion Rate I</h3><p>Completion rate 1= (Graduated + Continuers) / (Graduated + Continuers + Dropouts + Summer Dropout)</p><p>If in the 2010/2011 current school year, then Cohort = students entering 9<sup>th</sup> grade in the 2006/2007 school year (as indicated by transcript) who:</p><ul><li>Graduated anytime in the four years prior to the 2009/2010 school year (leaver code 01) &ndash; by Aug 31, 2010</li><li>Dropped out anytime in the last 4 years prior to August 31<sup>st</sup>with leaver code 98</li><li>Summer dropout&mdash;of the 12<sup>th</sup> graders at the end of the 2009/2010 year with no leaver code and &nbsp;<u>not</u> enrolled in the 2010/11 school year &nbsp;as of Sept 30<sup>th</sup>, 2010</li><li>Continuers&mdash;of the 12<sup>th</sup> graders at the end of the 2009/2010 year with no leaver code and enrolled in the 2010/11 school year&nbsp;as of Sept 30<sup>th</sup>, 2010</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: </em></p><ul><li><em>Dropouts do not account for those who later received a GED. </em></li><li><em>It also does not account for any other exclusions such as TJPC or TYC facilities, migrant students who enroll by mid January, students not eligible for FSP funding).</em></li></ul><h3>Computing Longitudinal Rates</h3><p>The four student outcomes used in computing the longitudinal rates are:</p><p><strong>(1) <em>Graduated</em></strong></p><ul><li>Based on the 2004-05 cohort, this shows the percent who received their high school diploma on time or earlier - by August 31, 2008.

It is calculated as follows:</li><li>Number of students from the cohort who were enrolled for the 2008-09 school year <em>divided by</em> Number of students in the 2004-05 cohort*</li></ul><p><strong>(4) <em>Dropped Out (4-yr)</em></strong></p><ul><li>Based on the 2004-05 cohort, this shows the percentage who dropped out and did not return by the fall of the 2008-09 school year. It is calculated as follows:</li><li>Number of students from the cohort who dropped out before the fall of the 2008-09 school year <em>divided by</em> Number of students in the 2004-05 cohort*</li><li>* The cohort in the denominator of the formulas shown above includes those students who graduated, continued in school, received a GED, or dropped out. It does not include data errors or leavers with the following leaver reason codes.
