# About These Handbooks

These Ed-Fi handbooks are searchable references that includes definitions for
every entity and element in a given data model or XML file model. The handbooks
complement the visual data model diagrams by providing detailed type
specifications, cardinality, usage, an XSD (normative) and SQL (non-normative)
expression, and other information about the elements and entities that make up
the Ed-Fi Data Model.
