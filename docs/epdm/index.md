# Educator Preparation Data Model (EPDM)

The core Educator Preparation Data Model (EPDM) core domain captures data that
allows an Educator Preparation Provider (EPP) to understand and answer key
questions relating to teacher candidate development.

The EPDM domains and entities will:

* Allow administrators to use data to understand and increase the diversity of
  educator candidates
* Provide key information on the performance of candidates in their clinical
  placement and allow them to improve program performance

The "Community" data models represent further extensions to the EPDM that are
not included in the core EPDM out of the box. They may be included at a future
date.
